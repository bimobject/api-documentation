> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to use the [3d Preview](/03-3d-preview/README.md) or [File download](/04-file-download/README.md) you must select **Client Credentials** as your authentication flow.

> [!NOTE]  
> The **Client Credentials** flow does not use the redirect uri, but for different reasons the field is still required. So please enter your application or company website.

## Using the app

Once you have created an app it will generate a **Client Id** and **Client Secret** that you now can use to access Bimobject's API.<br>
Instructions on how to do that can be found in the [Authentication](/02-authentication/README.md) document.
